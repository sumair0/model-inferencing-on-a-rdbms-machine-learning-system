// This class encapsulates a multi-threaded sever in PDB.  The way it works is that one simply
// registers
// an event handler (encapsulated inside of a PDBWorkPtr); whenever there is a new connection that
// comes
// over the given port (or file in the case of a local socket) a PWBWorker is asked to handle the
// connection using the appropriate port using a cloned version of the specified PDBWork object.
